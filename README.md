# Recipes
This is a simple demo project to put all my HTML knowledge into practice. 
I'll be using simple tags for paragraphs, bold, italics, images, headings and hyperlinks.
The website will contain a main image and names of some recipes, these recipes will be linked to other pages which will contain an image of the end product and the detailed instructions on how to make them.

Will revisit the project after advancing my skills more to format the page into a more user friendly environament which is pleasing to the eyes too.
